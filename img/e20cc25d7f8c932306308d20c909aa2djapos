As regards my goals, I may reckon that since ever I have been really interested in the videogames' production. However, in Spain there are not public universities with this kind of degrees so this is why I am addressing to you since this course will allow me to get introduced for sure in the game development.


As you may know, right now I am studying a Computer Engineering while I am working with a scholarship in order to help my family to pay my studies. Consequently, for this, plus the high price of private universities, I can not learn the field of study which I am really interested in. 

Since I started the university I have not worked because of the hard studies. My parents pays the bills' university and my life in general so I do not want them to pay me more things. Although I do not pay the mortgage and the food I try to help my parents in everything I can, so this is why I apply for this finantial aid in order to improve my knowledge in this field which is the one I am interested in.   

As this is not the first time I am coursing a Coursera course I had had experience in reviewing the assignments of my classmates because I recieved e-mails asking for help in this kind of things. Also, I would like to say that I read the discussions and if my knowledge lets me, I participate in order to help.
